# Automation!

I have been able to automate the elaboration of a macroeconomic report using Python. 

The report has around 60 variables that need to be updated on a monthly basis. The report is a summary of several statistics such as: 

- Employment Statistics 
- Balance of Trade
- Government Budget 
- Oil Production 
- Inflation 

In order to update the Excel report, I needed to manually open 7 distinct Excel's and find the values. To later copy and paste them in the report. 

Now, I have written a Python Script that is able to update the report automatically without opening a single Excel. 

I have written the Python code using libraries such as Pandas, Openpyxl, and Os.
